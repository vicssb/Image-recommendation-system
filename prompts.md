# Criação do readme.md inicial

- crie um readme.md com base em: https://web.dio.me/lab/sistema-de-recomendacao-por-imagens-digitais/learning/606bf02f-53a0-4e33-9e06-4c400d1995a0?back=/track/formacao-machine-learning-specialist


#String Alpha

- Create an automation capable of classifying images by similarity and generating results for the user of the website http://shopee.com.br/. The image must be the one contained in the "Image Recommendation System" folder on Google Drive. After selecting the image in Google Drive, display the image. Use the OpenCV library for image processing and Google Gemini as the LLM. The expected results are directed so that, through a product search on the internet, the Recommendation System displays related products, but not by their textual data (price, model, brand, store) but rather by their physical appearance (shape, color, texture, etc.).
